Hi 

Please check out the branch name master.

Entire code is written inside the src/test/java folder

All tests trigger from Factory.java class which is present udnder src/test/java
Same is placed in testng.xml file.

There is a class with name Constants.java under Utils package. Here we can give browser name and movie name.
Just provide those values and run the testng.xml file, that's it.

once execution is completed, we can see the reports under extent-reports folder.

Thank you.
