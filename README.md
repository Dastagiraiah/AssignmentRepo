Entire code is written inside the src/test/java folder

All tests trigger from Factory.java class which is present under
Same is place in testng.xml file.

There is class with name Constants where we can give browser name and movie name.
Just provide those values and run the testng.xml file, that's it.

once execution is completed, we can see the reports under extent-reports folder.

Thank you.
